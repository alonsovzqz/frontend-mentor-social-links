## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned how to add custom fonts to projects using `ttf` local files. Also I learned how to structure my CSS code better in order to create helper classes to make them re-usable.

### Continued development

I'd like to create a whole project out of this. Like use React.js to create a front-end and add icons to the social media links and create a back-end to control the links displayed. Add features to support users and more!

### Useful resources

- [Digital Ocean - CSS font face](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/css-font-face) - This helped me to understand how to add a custom `font-face`, set their proper weights and even to how to control font loading (not using in this project tho).
